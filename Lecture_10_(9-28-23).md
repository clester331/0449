## Memory Management

### Review

* A program has several sections:
  * Code
  * Static data
  * Stack
  * Heap

 * malloc and calloc stake out space in the heap and return an address

## Allocation

### Heaps

* Stack access often does not deviate much
  * We allocate a little bit at a time
  * We allocate and free the memory very often

* Heap allocations have any access patterns that are possible
  * You might allocate a lot at a time and keep it around for a long time. Or a short time
  * You might allocate a lot of small things, instead.
  * Or do a bit of everything

* Often, such patterns are not easy to predict
  
* Allocations could happen in a nice order.
* When Something is allocated, it can be allocated after everything else
* When freed, it makes room for new things

### Fragmentation

* Small allocations interfere with large ones
* When small gapsinterfere with allocation, this is called fragmentation

### The Worst Case

* When you allocate a lot of small things:
  * Free every other one and then attempt to make a bigger things
  * Even through there is technically enough memory, there is no continuous space, therefore our native malloc will fail.

* A defragmentation process/algorithm can be used to move things around, but moving something in the heap is hard
  * Any pointers referring to data within a block must be updated
  * Finding these pointers automatically is effective as difficult as garbage collection
  * Because of this, moving blocks around is discouraged. (easier to solve another way)
 
* If we allocate a large array it will be allocated on the heap somewhere
* Other allocations can also happen, and they go "above" that array
* When more space is needed, you will need to reallocate more sapce
  * And then copy the array contents, then free the old array.
 
### Big Arrays

* This happens in very practical situation:
  * Reallocating means getting rid of small things and replacing it with a larger thing
  * You could have TiBs of memory and this will be a problem
 
* This affects performance: (in terms of writes:)
  * Appending item ar[0]: O(1)
  * Appending item arr[1]: O(1)
  * ...
  * Appending item arr[99]: O(1)
  * Appending item arr[100]: O(n + 1)
 
* When you would overflow the buffer, you then need to copy all the previous values as well

### Performance Consistency

* Big arrays want to be continuous
  * Ensuring continuous space is difficult when you do not know how much you will ultimately need
  * This is exactly why linked lists exist
  * Since a linked list allocates on every append.
    * Each append takes the same amount of time
  * However, everything is a trade-off
    * One cost is extra overhead for metadata
    * Linked list traversal can stress memory caches
      * It means traversing the array is slower

## Linked Lists

### Linked List Intro

* A linked list is a non-continuous data structure representing an ordered list

* Each item in th elinked list is represented by metadata called a node
  * This metadata indirectly refers to the actual data.
  * Furthermore, it indirectly refers to at leas one other item in the lsit

* Creation of a list occurs when one allocates a single node and tracks it in a pointer. This is the head of our list (first element)

* If we want to append an item, we can add a node anywhere

### Traversal

* Accessing an array element is generally very simple:
  * arr[42] is the same as *(arr + 42) because its location is very well known
  * This is because array items are continuous in memory. Not true for linked lists
* Here is a function that perfomrs the equivalent for linked lists
