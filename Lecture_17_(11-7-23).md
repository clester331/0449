## Interrupts

* An **interrupt** is an exceptional state that diverts execution from its normal flow
  * When issued by hardware, sometimes referred to as a **hardware exception**
    * For isntance, a hardware timer or external event caused by a sensor
  * When caused by user process, sometimes referred to as a **software trap**
    * Divide by xero error, some floating point exceptions, system calls

* Seen before in:
  * System calls are a type of interrupt (software trap)
  * This is an intentional interrupt caused by a specific program isntruction
    * The program is interruped while the OS performs a task
   
* System calls: Predictablem intentional interrupts at specific instructions
  * Interrupts occuring at specific instructions are synchronous interrupts
* In the x86-64, the program pauses at a syscall instruction, then resumes at the following instruction where the OS finishes the task

### Programming interruption

* On most hardware, there is a programmable table somewhere in memory that, when written to, defines where code exists to handle each interrupt
* Every possible interrupt is given a number. Segmentation faults might be interrupt 10. Timers might be interrupt 0. Etc,.

# How Programs Reproduce

## Creating Processes

### Fork

* This system call copies the current process and creates a child process

### Fork in actino

* fork() copties the memory layout and it copies the process state (but gives it a unique ID)
* It updates the child's CPU state so that it returns 0 (An invalid pid)

### Spawn

* There is only one process called when spawn() is called

* Hoewever, when fork() is called, the system call returns "twice"
  * Once in the parent process
  * Once in the child process
 
* This starts two concurrent executions whihin the same program
  * Via two processes
 
* If the child process goes first, then it will print the child text
* Then, the scheduler schedules the parent process onece more, then it will print the parent text
* Hoever, that is not the only possible pattern. If the parent goes first...
  * Then it prints the parent text followed by the child

### Wait

* Adding concurrency to your program can make things weird
  * You cannot rely on the order processes will be synchronized
  * Your operations will be asynchronous
* If you need to synchronize processes, you can do so with wait()
* wait() yields the processes and returns only when a child process ends
  * It returns when any child process exits
 
* By using wait() the parent proces sonly continues when the  child process ends
* Therefore, the output order is now known

* INPUT ORDER
  * The parent goes first
  * It gets struck at the wait() call
  * Then the child goes until it hits exit()
  * exit() ends the process
  * And the parent continues
 
### Zombies

* A terminated process still takes up space
  * All that process metadata sticks around
  * Until the parent tells the system it doesn't need it
* As long as the parent stays alive, the corpse of the child process sticks around to
* This is called a **zombie process**
  * They are processes that still exist and have an ID yet do not run and are no longer scheduled
