# Lecture 16

## How Programs Are Made

### Compilation: Simple Overview - Step 1

* The compiler takes source code (*.c files) and translates them into machine code
* This file is called an "object file" and is just potentially one part of the project
* The machine code is not quite an executable
  * The object file is JUST representing the code for that particular source file

### Compilation: Simple Overview - Step 2

* You may have multiple files that reference each other
* You break your project up into pieces similarly to your java programs
* The compiler treats them independently

### Compilation: Simple Overview - Step 3

* Then, each piece is merged together to form the executable
* This process is done by a linker and is called linking

### Compiler

* Input: Higher-level language code (e.g. C, Java(
* Output: Assembly language code (e.g. x86, ARM, MIPS)
* First there's a preprocessor step to handle #directives
* Compiler optimizations
  * "Level" of optimization specified by capital 'O' flag
 
### The Need for a Linker

* A **compiler** converts source code into machine code
* A **linked** merges pieces of machine code into an executable

* Why have a seperate tool for creating executables?
  * Mixing different languages together
  * Let's us break large programs up into smaller pieces
  * Those small pieces can come from others. Code reuse

### Inside the Box

* To understand what linkers do we need to see what an executable is made out of
* A linux executable is defined by the **executable and linkable format** (ELF) standard
  * Used for *.o files
  * And executables
  * and *.so (shared objects)

### Object File Format

* Object file header: size and position of the other pieces of the objects file
* Text segment: The machine code
* Data segment: data in the source file (binary)
* Relocation table: Identifies lines of code that need to be handled
* Symbol table: list of this file's labels and data that can be referenced
* Debugging information

#### Object File Information Tables

* Symbol Table holds list of "items" that may be used by other files
  * Non-local lables (function names for call)
  * Static data (Variables & literals that might be accesed across files) 
* Relocation Table holds list of "items" tat this file needs the address of later
  * Any lable or piece of static data referenced in an instruction in this file 
* Each file has its own symbol and relocation tables

### What is in the ELF

* THe remianing fields indicate where certain sections start
* An ELF executable containse these sections:
  * Segment headers
  * The symbol table

* Symbols can consist of
  * Functions
  * Global variables
  * Special sections

### Static

* The static keyword forces any symbol to be local to the current file. That is, it can not be referenced by any outside function
* This is because the symbol will not be included in the symbol table
* The linker will not be able to see it
* This is useful for avoiding **name collisions**, when two functions have the same name 

## Dynamic Linking

### PIC and PIE

* In order to allow code to be resident anywhere in memory, the compiler must emit machine code that always uses relative addresses
* This is called **Position Independent Code** (or PIC).
* When your entire executable is made out of PIC, it is a **Position Indepenent Executable** (or PIE)
* gcc will compile code this way when you specify the -fPIC flag

### Running a Program (redux)

1. Thake The ELF executable
2. Place and initially prepeare the .text, .data, .bss segments into memory
5. Allocate the stack and assign the stack pointer (%rsp)
6. Repeatedly load each required shared library
  6a. Place .text and .data in memory
  6b. Rewrite .text setions by looking at the relocatable entries
  6c. Repeat for each library 
7.  Jump to the entry point address (the location of the _start symbol)

### Run-time Loading

* Having the OS load every library at the start can delay the execution of a program
* We can make use of an OS service to dynamically load libraries

### Linking, loading; Static and Dynamic

* Linking is when we merge multiple pieces of executable code into one logical program
* We link at various times:
  * At **compile-time**: using *.o files and static libraries (*.a)
  * At **load-time**: our OS reads and loads the executable and loads dynamic libraries (*.so) at the same time, rewrutung relocatable sections
  * At **run-time**: our ptogram uses system services (dlopen) to load dynamic libraries lazily
