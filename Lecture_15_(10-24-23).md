## Buffer Overflow

### Memory Review

* Stack
  * Local variables
* Heap
  * Dynamically allocated as needed
  * malloc(), calloc(), new()
* Statically allocated data
  * Red/write: global variables
  * Read-only: string literals
* Code/instructions
  * Executable machine instructions
  * Read only
 
### x86-64 Linux Memory Layout

* Stack
  * Runtime stack (8MB limit)
  * e.g., local variables
* Heap
  * Dynamic allocated as needed
  * When call malloc(), new()
* Data
  * Statically allocated data
  * e.g., global/static vars, string constatns
* Text / Shared Libraries
  * Executable machine instructions
  * Read-only

### x86-64 Stack Frame

* Caller's Stack Frame
  * Arguments (if > 6 args) for this call

* Current/Calle Stack Frame
  * Return address
    * Pushed by call instruction
  * Old frame pointer (optional)
  * Saved register contect (when reusing registers)
  * Local Variables (If can't be kept in register)
  * "Argument build" area (If calle needs to call another function - parameters for function about to call, if needed)

### Buffer Overflow

* Traditional Linux memory layout provides opportunities for malicious programs
  * Stack grows "backwards" in memory
  * Data and instructions both stored in the same memory
* Recall that C does not check array bounds
  * Many Unix/Linux/C functions don't check argument sizes
  * Allows overflowing (writing past the end) of buffers (arrays)
 
* Buffer overflows on the stack can overwrite "interesting" data
  * Attackers justchoose the right inputs

* Simplest form (sometimes called "stack smashing")
  * Unchecled length on string input into bounded array causes overwriting of stack data
  * Try to change the return address of the current procedure
 
## Dealing with buffer overflow attacks

* Use library routines that limit string lengths
  * fgets instead of gets (2nd argument to fgets sets limit)
  * strncpy instead of strcpy
  * Don't use scanf whith %s convention specification
    * Use fgets to read the string
    * Or use %ns where n is a suitable integer
   
* System evel Protections
  * Randomize stack offsets
    * At start of program, allocate random amount of space on stack
    * Shifts stack address for entire program
      * Addresses will vary from one run to another
    * Makes it difficult for hacker to predict beginning of inserted code
  * Non-executable code segments
    * In traditional x86, can mark region of memory as either "read only" or "writable"
      * Can execute anything readable
    * x86-64 added explicit "execute" permission
    * Stak marked as non-executable
      * So NOT execute code in stack, static data, or heap regions
      * Hardware support needed              

* Stack Canaries
  * Basic idea: place special value ("canary") on stack just beyond buffer
    * Secret value known only to compiler
    * "after" buffer but return address
    * Check for corruption before exiting function
