### Implementing free

* When we free block, we look to the left and the right
  * We **coalesce** the newly free block with any adjacent free blocks

* Finding the header metadata node is simple
  * Look at out malloc's return
* free is slightly less complex
  * It does not have to search
* Where malloc splits nodes
  * free merges them
* Whenever a block is freed next to an existing one
  * It should merge them
* Consider how much a doubly linked list helped

### Next-fit

* With a typical first-fit of the malloc-function
  * We can now consider simple improvements
  * Traversing th elist is expensive O(n)
* Next-fit helps because we start from the last allocated item
* Therefore, free space will exist near the last allocation
  * Causes the average case for malloc to bias itself towards O(1)

 ### Best-fit

* Best-fit, on the other hand, is not about avoiding traversal, but rather focusing on fragmentation
* Allocating anywhere means worst-case behavior splits nodes poorly
   * If we find a perfect fit, we remove fragmentation
* Traversal is still bad and we brute force the search

### Other Thoughts

* You don't need next pointers since adding size to the block's address will also move there
* You don't need to keep the used blocks in the lsit
  * More complex to understand but removes implementation complexity
  * Free nodes point to the next and previous free nodes. Used nodes point to their neighbors. Traversal is improved since it only visits free nodes
* The idea is to keep track of necessary metadata
  * You only calesce when free blocks are adjacent
  * With a list of only free block, you can easily tell when that condition is met
    * Just see if node -> next is the same address as (char*)(node + 1) + node -> size
* The only other concern is getting from a used block you want to free to its neighboring free block. So those have pointers

### Explicit free lists

* When you allocate, you go through the free list
  * You don't care about allocated nodes
* When you free, you only care about coalescing nieghbors

### Boundary tags and fancy tricks

* **Boundary tags** are when you put the size as the first and last item in the block to avoid next and previous pointers
* This is an **implicit list** since there are not pointers
  * You navigate next/previous by adding/subtracting the size
  * Although, once again, free nodes do not need to go backwards
* They do not necessarily improve upon explicit lists.
