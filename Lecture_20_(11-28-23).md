## Synchronization

### Threads

* Process level concurrency with fork() is powerful but infelxible
  * The OS schedules the task, incuring context switching overhead
  * The proess memory is opied making it hard to share data among tasks.

* A **thread** is a concurrency primitive that is inner-process
  * The program itself schedules the task as part of the same process
  * Process memory, therefore, is shared across all threads

### Fork in action

* Fork copies the memory layout and capies the process state (but gives it a unique ID)

* Threads will still retain much of the address space
  * Threads share code/data/etc/ however, they have their own stack and CPU state
  * They execute in parallel with one another interacting directly with the same data
 
### libpthread

* The 2011 amendment to C standard (C11) added a threading API
* We will be reviewing the pthread standard
  * The C11 threads.h API is still very similar
  * There are ports of the pthread.h interface to many OSes
  * Lots of threading APIs in other languages emulate it
 
### POSIX   

* The "p" is pthread stands for the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
  * This is a standard for creating OS abstractions
  * Intended to lower the burden of porting applications

* POSIX standardizes threads, but also process creating and behavior of fork, file abstractions, and how data is shared among processes

### Weaving a thread

* main is within the main thread()
* The pthread_create function creates a second thread, which runs alongside the main thread
  * The first argument is the address of a variable to hold the thread ID
  * The NULL is where you can add some flags, but the defaults are OK
  * The thread is the function to use
  * The last argument is passed to that funcion and generally an address
 
* When the process exits normally, all threads are also cancelled, even if they haven't completed
* In this run, the second thread never prints its message

```cmd
> ./thrd_bad
Done!
```

 * pthread_join() waits for the given thread to exit by thread ID
   * The NULL is, again, optional flags
* Here, the main thread waits until the function completes
* It prints out the string given by the argument

```cmd
> ./thrd
Hello, students!
Done!
```

* Unlike process-level concurrency using fork(), threads share memory
* Each thread, here, shares access to the same global variable counter
  * When the main thread updates, the secondary thread sees that value
* Threads share the same virtual address space and page table
  * They only have their own stack and CPU state

## Synchronization

* The rail system requires alot of attention to detail to provide
  * Orderly and timely scheduling of trains
  * Shared use of a single resource: rail
  * Coordination with trains and competiing interests
 
* In order to provide this, trains make use of signals and switching areas
  * Trains wait while others pass, all agreeing on the nature of signals
  * The signals are called **semaphores**

### Seminal Semaphore

* A **semaphore** is a special counter used for synchronization
* The counter is a signed integer that often starts at zero or one
* Two defined operations:
  * Up (signal/release)
  * Down (wait/acquire)
* These operations often have different names or are abbreviated
  * V -> release
  * P -> pass   

### Preventing Derailment

* sem_init() creates a new semaphore
  * The first argument is an address to a variable that will hold the semaphore data.
  * The second arguent, when 0, means that other thread can see the semaphore. Non-zero means other threads cannot interact with the semaphore, which is a bit more advanced
  * The third argument is the initial value (1)
 
* sem_wait() decrements the counter
  * Waits to dcrement if the counter is 0
* sem_post() increments the counter
  * May release a thread waiting at sem_wait()
