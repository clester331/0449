## Introcution to x86 Assembly

### Assembly

* Human readable representation of code
* Machine code is what a computer actually tuns

* Involves very simple commands
* Commands are a shorthand for a different set of instructions that get transformed into a numerical representation
* The processor then interprets the binary representation

### Assembly vs Machine Language.

* Machine language instructions are the patterns of bits that a processor reads to know what to do
* Assembly language (or "asm") is a human readable representation of machine language

### Debugging

* Programs written in C are generally translated into assembly
* You can look at the machine code of programs and get an assembly code listing
* When programs crash, you can look at the assembly code and assess

## Basics of x86

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

* An ISA is the interface that a CPU presents to the programmer
* The ISA defines:
  * What the CPU can do (add, subtract, call functions, etc)
  * What registers it has
  * The machine language
* The ISA does not define the hardware

### RISC

* Reduced Instruction Set Computer
* ISA desinged to make it easy to:
  * build the CPU hardware
  * Make that hardware run fast
  * Write compilers that make machine code
* Small number of instructions
* Very simple instructions 

### CISC

* Complex Instruction Set Computer
* ISA designed for humans to write asm
* Lota of instructions and ways to use them
* Comlpex (multi-step) instructinos to shorted and simplify programs

### x86

* Descended from 16-bit 8086 CPU from 1978
* Extendes to 32 bits, then 64
* Each versino can run most programs from the previous version
* This is ISA complex
  * 30 years of backwards compatibility

### x86 Registers
* Like MIPS, there are a set of general purpose registers
* Unlike MIPS, you can refer to parts of each register (called **Patrital Registers**)
