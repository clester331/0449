## Linked Lists

### Linked List Traversal

* Accessing an array element is generally very simple
  * arr[42] is the same as *(arr + 42) because its location is very well known
  * This is because array items are continuous in memory. Not true for linked lists
 
### Linked List Removal

* One nice thing about linked lists is their felxability to changing shape
* Since we don't have a way to go "backwards":
  * We first find what node we want to delete (currNode)
  * Keeping track of the node of index-1 (lastNode)
  * Rewire lastNode to cut out curNode

* It takes O(n) time to find the item
* It performs a simple update and deallocation. (quick to do)

* For a big array:
  * It can find the element to remove immediately
  * However, removing it means shifting over every item after it left
  * That can be an expensive update (memory is slow)

### More About Linked Lists

* Consider how much cleaner you can make operations if you tracked the previous node as well
  * This is a **doubly linked list**
  * This is typically "double-ended" as well: keeping track of both sides of the head and tail

### Binary Trees

* A **binary tree** can be represented by the same nodes as a linked list
  * In this case, you can have a left and right chold node instead of next and prev

### Destressing

* Big arrays want to be continouous, however, ensuring continuous space is difficult when you do not know how much you wlll ultimately need
* Linked lists allocate very small chunks of metadata
  * These chunks can be allocated easily on-demand
  * And then dealocated without creating wide gaps
* This reduces fragmentation
  * Deallocating always leaves a small amount of room
  * It is always the exact amount neede to append!
  * However it is all at the expense of complexity
  * And traversals can be expensive   

## Implementing Malloc

### Malloc Essentials

* The malloc(size_t size) function does the following:
  * Allocates memory of at least *size* bytes
  * Returns the address to that block of memory (or NULL or error)
* Essentially, your program has a potentially large amount of memory
  * The malloc function tears off a piece of the chunk
  * Also free must then allow that chunk to be reused
  * The job of malloc is to do so in the "best" way to reduce fragmentation
 
### Choosing Where to Allocate

* Our first problem is, when malloc is called, where do we tear off a chunk?
* We can do a few simple things
  * **First-Fit**: start at lowest address, find first available section
    * Fast, but small blocks clog up the works
  * **Next-fit**: Do "First-Fit" but start where we last allocated
    * Fast and spreads small blocks around a little better
  * **Best-fit**: Laboriously look for the smallest available section to divide up
    * Slow, but limits fragmentation 

### Managing Metadada

* You have a whole section of memory to divide up
* You need to keep track of what is allocated and what is free
* One of the least complicated ways of doing so is to use a linked list
* We can treat each allocated block (and each empty space) as a node in a linked list
  * Allocating Memory is just appending a node to our list
* The trick is to think about how we want to split up the nodes representing available memory

### Tracking Memory

* Lets orient our memory visually horizontally
  * We have control over every byte of it. We can place metadata anywhere
* Every malloc is responsible for allocating a block of memory
  * We can have "allocation" reduce to create a new node

* We will augment our normal doubly linked list to be useful for tracking the size of the block it represents. (an explicit list allocator)
* Here, we will maintain a single linked lists of all allocated or free blocks
  * The size field denotes how big the block is (how much is used/available)
  * We need to know when a block represents allocated space or it is free

### High level metadata

* We can keep track of used/empty spaces cheaply by having linked list nodes at the beginning of them. The nodes track the size of the space
  * Here, we have an allocated block followed by a free and then allocated block
  * The metadata for the linked list is just smashed into the block itself

### Implementing Malloc

* To allocate some amount of space, we find a free block that is at least that size + metadata size (first-fit).
  * Then we will want to spit that free block

* Allocating means finding a free block big enough
  * Including the metadata size
* Then splitting it into a used block and a smaller free block
