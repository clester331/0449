# Lecture 14

## Going With the Flow

* The C Application Binary Interface (ABI) are assembly naming conventions
  * Like MIPS, certain registers are typically used for return values, args, etc
  * It is not defined by the language, but rather the OS

* In our x86-64 Linux C ABI, registers are used to pass arguments:
  * %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8, %r9 (First, second, etc) (Like MIPS a0 – a3)
  * remaining arguments go on the stack
  * callee must perserve %rbp, %rbx, %r12, %r13, %r14, %r15 (Like MIPS s0 – s7)
  * return value: %rax
 
### Activation Frame

* The activation drame contains temporary data needed by the function
  * %rax is the return value
  * %rsp is the current stack address
  * %rbp is the address of this frame  

* First: it fills the activation frame with initial values.
  * It may not allocate them in any strict order. Here, it allocates x first and further away
  * When identifying functions, you are looking for that tell-tale sandwich pattern
  * A push is a good sign of the beginning of a function
  * And the pop will happen before the ret ant the end

### Control Flow

* Control flow is a cmp or test followed by j*
  * cmp will set FLAGS based on the differene (subtraction) between values
  * test will set FLAGS based on bitwise AND of both values (faster, but less useful)
* j* group set %rip (program counter) to an address based on FLAGS
  * Often, it is much more useful to just interpret the jmp (jge is >=)
 
### Flags

* Flags has the bits that are set based on the ALU (CPU math logic) result
  * SF - most significant bit of result
  * OF - set if overflowed occurred
  * ZF - set if result is zero
  * CF - set if last bit operation has a carry
* Each jump looks at different FLAGS patterns.
  * jns - Jump when SF = 0
  * jge - set if SF = 0F or ZF = 1

### Test

* Test is somewhat stranger and requires some more thought
  * Performs an AND of the arguments and sets flags on the result
 
* Thankfully, generally only commonly used in a couple of cases
  * Generally to test a value against "true" or "false"
  * Recall that jne and je will look at the zero flag ( FLAGS[ZF] )
