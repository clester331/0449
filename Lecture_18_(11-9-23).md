### How To Run a Different Program

* WHen you fork() a process, you are making an exact copy of that process
* However, maybe you want to create a process to run a different program altogether
  * This is very useful instead of using software library
  * You could just run the existing program
* For this purpose, the exec*() famile of syscalls are used

### execv()

* Using the execv() system call
  * The call thakes the path to an executable and an array of strings for the arguments
    * SSentinel: must end in a NULL
  * The first argument to a C program is always its own path
 
* The fork() system call in action:
  * Copies the memory layout. Copies the process state. (But gives it a unique ID)
* The execv() system call in action:
  * will have a new set of parameters and a new ID

### Different forms of exec

* You can look up the many different styles of exec. each one has a different way of calling it
  * execv - called with an array of strings terminated with a NULL
  * execve - same, but can use specific environment variables
  * execvp - searches the system paths for the executable
  * execvpe - combination of execve and execvp
 
### The Common Ancestor

* UNIX/Linux has an interesting design: every application is a child process

## Inter-Process Communication

* Passing data or messages from one process to another is called **inter-process communication**
* This is a board OS topic as there are many ways to do this
* Message passing is a fancy way of saying we are using an API to send a small message to another process

* In UNIX/Linux, tiny messages sent between processes are called **signals**
* They are typically used to send messages about events from the system. Here are a few:

### Recieving Signals

* The signal() standard function will set up your application to listen for a particular signal
* This example hooks the empty function sigint_handler to override the deafult behavior of the SIGINT signal
* The proper use of signals and waiting on the values of variables to change can create **Synchronization**

* goods_count = 0 and wait_count = 0

* When you have concurrent tasks, they may compete
* A bug in a concurrent program where the logic breaks if one process out-paces another is called a **race condition**
  * That is, if the correctness requires a strict order, but that order isnot garunteed
* When you add synchronization you need to be careful that you ensure that each synchronized section (called a **Critical section**) is logically sound  

### Summary

* Programs
  * They start as processes (children of a shell or some root process)
  * They can spawn child processes using fork()
  * They can load executables over top of them using exec*() system calls
  * If one process ends before the other, we get zombies or orphans

* Signals
  * These are tiny messages sent using kill() function; recieved via signal()
  * We can use them to synchronize events between processes
  * However, if we aren't careful, we may introduce a bug called a race condition
  * This is when the program requires a logical order it cannot garuntee
