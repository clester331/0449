## The C Syntax

### C Dialects

* Although there are alot of different styles of C, the syntax has changed very little
  * Course will focus on the C99 standard 

### C vs Java

* C: int
  * Integer type that targets the processor it works most efficiently with
  * For modern C, this is generally a good-enough default choice
* Only Garuntee
  * sizeof(long long) >= sizeof(long) >= sizeof(int) >= sizeof(short)
  * Also, short >= 16 bits, long >= 32 bits
  * All could be 64 bits     

### Short note on incremenotrs
* b = a++ -> b = a -> a = a+1
* b = ++a -> a = a+1 -> b = a

### Expressions
* C often coreces (implicitly casts) integers when operation on them
* To remove ambiguity, expressions, such as (a & b), result in a type that most accomodates that operation
* Specifically, C will coerce all inputs of binary operations to at least an int type

## Compiling

### Compilation
* Code is generally converted into machine code
* Java, by contrast, indirectly converts to machine code using a byte-code
* Python, by contrast to both, interprets the code

* The difference is in a trade-off about how to create a machine-level representation of the source code.

* A genreal C compiler will typically convert *.c source files into an intermediate *.o object file. Then it will link thsee together to form an executable
  * Assembly is also part of the process, but it's done behind the scenes
  * You can have gcc (a common C ompiler) spit out the assemply if you want

### Compilation vs Interpretation

* C (compiled)
  * COmpiler + linker translates code into machine code
  * Machine code can be directly loaded by the OS and executed by the hardware. Usually Fast
  * New hardware targets require recompilation in order to executre on those new systems

* Python (interpreted)
  * Interpreter is writen in some language (e.g. C) that is itself translated into machine code
  * The Python source code is then executed as it is read by the interperter. Usually Slower.
  * Very portable. No reliance on hardware beyond the interpreter.
 
### Compilation vs. Virtual Targets (bytecode)

* Java translates source to a "byte code" whic is a made-up architecture, but it resembles machine code somewhat.
* Technically, architectures could execute this byte code directly
  * Instead, a type of virtual machine simulates that pseudo-architecture
    * Periodically, the face byte code is translated to machine code.
    * This is a type of delayed compilation. Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation.  

### The C Pre-Processor

* The C language is incredibly simplistic
* To add some constrained complexity, there is a macro language
  * This code does not get translated to machine code, but to more code
